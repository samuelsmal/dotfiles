-[ ] add dropbox installer
-[ ] add android studio
-[x] add keyboard shortcut exporter
-[ ] add thunderbird (fix google setup)
-[ ] add ssh permission fix
-[ ] checkout https://github.com/MeesCode/NordVPN-GNOME-Extention
-[x] find a way to setup up ssh stuff in a good way
-[ ] fix keyboard shortcut exporter (does not set, path could be wrong?)

## What I use (and why)

- stow (to setup the dotfiles)
- gnome3
- fedora
- snaps (to isolate some packages I don't really trust, and to make the installation process easy)
- wmctrl (to switch to already open windows)
- keepassx (works everywhere)
- conda (python)
- your ssh config will
